                                This not yet another fantasy card game, there are plenty out there, instead we have

                                Natural language processing will create and segment flavorful classes such as

                                create their stats such as power, toughness and abilities based on their wikipedia page.<br/>

                                Creative common images will be used to create the card images.

                                The reason it&apos;s autonomous and evolutionary is that there is no single entity

                                profitable company behind it, making the rules.
