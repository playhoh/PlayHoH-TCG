                                You&apos;re about to experience an autonomous, evolutionary trading card game, inspired

                                Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone.
                                Be part of a <strong>democratic card adjustment system</strong> to have a healthy
                                competitive environment that is not controlled by a single centralised company.

                                This not yet another fantasy card game, there are plenty out there, instead we have
                                the <strong>full real-world historic person cast</strong>, from Aristotle to Nikola
                                Tesla and beyond.

                                Machine learning will use publicly available information to generate playable cards of

                                Natural language processing will create and segment flavorful classes such as

                                create their stats such as power, toughness and abilities based on their wikipedia page.<br/>

                                Creative common images will be used to create the card images.

                                Once every quarter the machine learning algorithm will spill out 250 new tokenized cards

                                <br/>
                                To make sure the game (and their cards) stay balanced, every player can vote on too
                                powerful or bad cards to improve them in the first week of the season.

                                The whole idea is to give players ownership over their items. Ethereum was born because

                                The reason it&apos;s autonomous and evolutionary is that there is no single entity
                                controlling the rules of a game. Esports can never be olympic, if there is a centralized
                                profitable company behind it, making the rules.
